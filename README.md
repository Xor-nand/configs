### *My configuration files and an easy (yet dangerous) installation script*

!! PLEASE read the dependency list before cloning the configuration file, if a package is missing, the the configuration cloning will lead to an enormous amount of errors. You've been warned. !!

### *"What do I have to install then?"*
you'll need a couple of packages, that all can be installed from the `updater` script, or by hands, one by one.

The packages you need are :
- `i3blocks`, to show the status in i3 bar,
- `pavucontrol`, an audio device manager,
- `feh`, pictures manager, used to set the wallpaper,
- `conky`, status widget, not essential,
- `networkmanager` and `nm-applet` to display and manage network,
- `termite`, a great and customizable terminal emulator,
- `udiskie`, to auto-mount usb drives,
- `xbacklight`, for the backlight,
- `thunar`, our trusted file manager,
- `compton`, just to make everything a bit more cute,
- `scrot`, screenshot tool,
- `rofi`, a program launcher, because the default one is ugly,
- `locker`, a locker made by me, link to github here "",
- `xrandr` is the best way I found to manage xorg,
- `i3gaps` for obvious reasons...
